Code files
----------

- main.py: load program arguments, graphs and set up RL agent and environment and conduct simulation, train RL agent(teacher).
- main_s.py: load program arguments, graphs and set up RL agent and environment and conduct simulation, train RL agent(student).
- test.py: test RL agent.
- models.py: define parameters and structures of BiGDN and BiGDNs.  
- agent.py: define agents to follow reinforcement learning procedure.
- environment.py: store the process of simulation.  
- utils.py: obtain graph information function and use Monte Carlo simulation of propagation range under IC model and ReplayBuffer.
- node_encoder/train.ipynb: implementation and Pre training of Node Encoder.
- graph_process.ipynb: process the graph by converting nodes into consecutive integers numbered from 0.

Please refer to the code for specific parameter settings and implementation.

Folders
----------

- test_graphs: there are 8 test graphs, the YouTube graph file is too large to upload.
- train_graphs: there are 15 training graphs, consistent with the training graphs of ToupleGDD.
- node_encoder: contains training graphs and training code used by NE.
